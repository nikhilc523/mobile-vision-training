# Fall Detection Project - Week 3 Report

**Student:** Nikhil Chowdary  
**Project:** Real-Time Fall Detection Using Pose Estimation and LSTM  
**Week:** 3 of 4 (October 31 - November 6, 2025)  
**Report Date:** November 8, 2025

---

## üìã Executive Summary

Week 3 focused on **feature engineering and initial LSTM training**. Successfully implemented 6 engineered features with temporal windowing and trained proof-of-concept LSTM model. However, only processed 4 videos (17 windows) instead of full 964-video dataset - **this is a critical blocker for Week 4**. Initial model achieved F1=0.857 on tiny dataset, validating architecture but requiring full-scale training.

### Key Metrics
- **Features Implemented:** 6/10 (60%)
- **Windows Generated:** 17 (from 4 videos) ‚ö†Ô∏è **Need ~10,000+ from 964 videos**
- **Model Trained:** ‚úÖ Proof-of-concept
- **Test F1 Score:** 0.857 (on 17 samples)
- **Model Size:** 79 KB (mobile-ready)
- **Time Spent:** 14 hours

### ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL BLOCKER
**Feature engineering NOT run on full dataset!** Only 17 windows from 4 videos. Must re-run on all 964 videos to generate ~10,000+ windows before final training in Week 4.

## üöß Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: High Window Dropout Rate (65.3%) ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Problem:** 65.3% of windows dropped due to >30% missing data threshold.

**Root Cause:**
- MoveNet has low confidence on many keypoints
- Especially in ADL sequences (sitting, lying)
- Occlusion and distance from camera

**Current Status:** Documented, not yet solved

**Potential Solutions for Week 4:**
1. Relax quality threshold to 40-50%
2. Implement keypoint interpolation for missing data
3. Use pose confidence as a feature instead of filtering

**Impact:** May reduce final window count from ~15,000 to ~10,000

---

### Challenge 2: Tiny Dataset for Training (17 samples)

**Problem:** Only 17 windows from 4 videos - not enough for meaningful training.

**Root Cause:** Feature engineering not run on full 964-video dataset.

**Solution:** **CRITICAL for Week 4** - Re-run feature engineering on all 964 videos.

**Action Items:**
1. Update `ml/features/feature_engineering.py` to process all datasets
2. Add CLI argument `--dataset all`
3. Run on full dataset
4. Verify ~10,000+ windows generated

---

### Challenge 3: Class Imbalance in Proof-of-Concept (76.5% fall)

**Problem:** Proof-of-concept dataset heavily skewed toward falls.

**Root Cause:** Only processed 2 fall videos and 2 non-fall videos.

**Solution:** Full dataset will have realistic balance (~18% fall / ~82% non-fall).

**Additional Solution:** Implement focal loss in Week 4 (Issue #10).

---

## üìö Learning Outcomes

1. **Feature Engineering:** Learned to design domain-specific features for fall detection (torso angle, hip height, velocity).

2. **Temporal Windowing:** Understood trade-offs between window size, stride, and dataset size.

3. **Quality Filtering:** Learned importance of data quality vs. quantity trade-off.

4. **LSTM Architecture:** Gained hands-on experience with sequence modeling and masking layers.

5. **Data Augmentation:** Implemented time-series specific augmentation techniques.

6. **Class Imbalance:** Understood impact of class weights and need for focal loss.

### Lessons Learned
- Always process full dataset early - don't wait
- Proof-of-concept is useful but not sufficient
- Feature engineering is time-consuming - plan accordingly
- Data quality filtering can significantly reduce dataset size
