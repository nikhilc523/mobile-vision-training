## 🚧 Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: MoveNet Thunder Tensor Shape Errors ⚠️

**Problem:** MoveNet Thunder (256×256 input) failed on ALL videos with error:
```
tensorflow.python.framework.errors_impl.InvalidArgumentError: 
Incompatible shapes: [1,12,12,64] vs. [1,16,16,64]
```

**Root Cause:** Thunder model has stricter input size requirements and fails on certain video resolutions, particularly:
- Videos with non-standard aspect ratios
- Videos with resolutions not divisible by 32
- Videos with very high or very low resolutions

**Attempted Solutions:**
1. ❌ Adjusted preprocessing (resize, padding) - Still failed
2. ❌ Tried different TensorFlow versions - Still failed
3. ❌ Reduced batch size to 1 - Still failed
4. ✅ **Switched to MoveNet Lightning (192×192)** - 100% success!

**Final Solution:**
- Switched from Thunder to Lightning variant
- Lightning is more robust to varying video resolutions
- Trade-off: Slightly less accurate but reliable extraction
- Result: 99.8% success rate (963/964 videos)

**Impact:**
- Lost ~2 hours debugging Thunder issues
- Gained valuable insight into model robustness
- Lightning proved sufficient for our use case

**Time Lost:** 2 hours

### Challenge 2: UCF101 Download Speed

**Problem:** UCF101 dataset is 6.5 GB, slow download from university servers.

**Solution:**
- Used aria2c for parallel downloading (16 connections)
- Downloaded overnight
- Verified checksums after download
- Result: Successful download in ~3 hours

**Time Impact:** Minimal (overnight download)

---

### Challenge 3: Memory Management for Large Batch Processing

**Problem:** Processing 964 videos sequentially could cause memory leaks.

**Solution:**
- Implemented per-video processing (not batch across videos)
- Explicit garbage collection after each video
- Progress saving with `--skip-existing` flag
- Result: Stable memory usage (~2 GB peak)

**Code:**
```python
import gc

for video_path in tqdm(video_paths):
    keypoints = extract_keypoints(video_path)
    save_keypoints(keypoints, output_path)
    
    # Explicit cleanup
    del keypoints
    gc.collect()
```

## 📚 Learning Outcomes

1. **Model Robustness:** Learned that larger models (Thunder) aren't always better - robustness matters more than marginal accuracy gains.

2. **Error Handling:** Gained experience debugging TensorFlow internal errors and finding workarounds.

3. **Data Pipeline:** Learned to build resumable, fault-tolerant data processing pipelines with progress tracking.

4. **Verification:** Understood importance of comprehensive data validation before training.

5. **Class Balance:** Learned how to balance datasets for realistic real-world distributions.

## 📈 Project Status

### Overall Progress: 50% Complete

| Phase | Status | Completion |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| Dataset Preparation | ✅ Complete | 100% |
| Pose Extraction | ✅ Complete | 100% |
| Feature Engineering | ⏳ Next Week | 0% |
| LSTM Training | ⏳ Next Week | 0% |
| Evaluation | ⏳ Week 4 | 0% |
| Deployment | ⏳ Future | 0% |

### Risks and Mitigation
- **Risk:** Feature engineering may generate fewer windows than expected due to quality filtering
  - **Mitigation:** Can relax quality threshold if needed, or implement keypoint interpolation
- **Risk:** LSTM training may require more epochs than planned
  - **Mitigation:** Implemented early stopping and learning rate scheduling

## 💡 Reflections

### What Went Well
- Successfully processed 964 videos with 99.8% success rate
- Achieved realistic class balance (18% fall / 82% non-fall)
- Created robust, resumable data pipeline
- 100% file validation success

### What Could Be Improved
- Should have tested both Thunder and Lightning models earlier
- Could have parallelized UCF101 download better
- Should have implemented verification script before extraction

### Lessons Learned
- Always test on small subset before full processing
- Model robustness > marginal accuracy gains
- Comprehensive verification is essential
- Real-world class imbalance matters for model performance
